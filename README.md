These activity focuses on exceptions, static and final keywords, collections, and streams in Java. The challenges involve implementing methods and classes that handle exceptions effectively.

## Challenge 1: Exceptions with Division
The first challenge involves testing a division method that handles different values for the numerator and denominator. It emphasizes the importance of managing division by zero and implementing appropriate exception handling.

## Challenge 2: Custom Exceptions with ColaDeTrabajo Class
