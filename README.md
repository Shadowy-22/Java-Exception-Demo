## Overview
These activities focuses on exceptions, static and final keywords, collections, and streams in Java. The challenges involve implementing methods and classes that handle exceptions effectively.

## Challenge 1: Exceptions with Division
The first challenge involves testing a division method that handles different values for the numerator and denominator. It emphasizes the importance of managing division by zero and implementing appropriate exception handling.

## Challenge 2: Custom Exceptions with ColaDeTrabajo Class
The second challenge requires creating the `ColaDeTrabajo` class to enqueue various jobs that implement the `Trabajo` interface. The class must handle job processing and ensure that exceptions are thrown when the queue is not ready or contains no jobs. 

This challenge highlights the significance of custom exception classes to manage specific error conditions in a queue system.

## Challenge 4: Stream Operations on Lists
The fourth challenge focuses on utilizing streams in Java to process collections in a functional and declarative manner. The challenge will work for example with a `List<String>` to perform operations such as filtering elements based on specific criteria, transforming them to uppercase, and sorting the results.
